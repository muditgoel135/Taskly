# Welcome to Your Docs Editor 📝

This is your **first editable document**.  
You can type, format, and save changes in real time. Let’s play around with some Markdown magic.

---

## ✍️ Basic Formatting
Try these out:
- **Bold text** — make it pop  
- *Italic text* — make it whisper  
- ~~Strikethrough~~ — for mistakes you regret  
- `Inline code` — for coders who flex  

You can mix them too: **bold *and* italic**.

## 📋 Lists
### Unordered list:
- Coffee
- Code
- Chaos

### Ordered list:
1. Wake up
2. Open your doc
3. Pretend to be productive

---

## 🧮 Code Blocks
Paste or write your code below:
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name} 👋")

greet("Editor User")
```

## 📅 Headings & Sections

Use headings to organize your doc:

### Level 3 heading

#### Level 4 heading

They’ll help keep long documents clean and scannable.

## 🕒 Autosave & Versioning

Your document saves automatically every few seconds after you stop typing.
You can check the **status indicator** in the toolbar for “Saved” or “Editing…”

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use **Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)** to save instantly.
* Use **Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I** for bold and italic.
* Copy some Markdown from anywhere and paste it here to test rendering.
